# MazeDungeon
A simple text-based dungeon that I made for the Python course I'm attending

## How to play
- move by typing the direction you want to go to
- If time is up or you lose your health, you will die
- You can get an extra score by collecting loot and defeating enemies
- You will lose points for each step you make

So use a good strategy and get the highest score possible!

## Planned Features
- Generating a new maze for a fresh experience each time
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
